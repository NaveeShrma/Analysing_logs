# Analysing_logs

Analyzing Logs Using certain open source tools for building any infrastructure for managing logs and for real time Analytics using tools. In this infrastructure we are using certain tools by which we can manage any live logs generated on any servers (i.e. website logs or system logs).

Any organization requires growing their business by means any media, that can be easily done by analyzing logs, such as click stream data or where are customers clicking on site or which particular browser they are using.
A log file is a file that records either event that occurs in an operating system or other software runs, or messages between different users of a communication software. 

Data constantly flows into your systems, but it can quickly grow to be fat and stale. As your data set grows larger, your analytics will slow up, resulting in sluggish insights. And this is likely to be a serious business problem. 

## Motivation

This Infrastructure is based on solving the basic needs for data flow at the backend in any organization.
